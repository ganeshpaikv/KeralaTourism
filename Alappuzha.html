<h1 style="padding-top: 2.5%;"><center>Alappuzha</center></h1>
<p style="padding-top: 1%; line-height: 8mm;">There is a diversity among the many places to visit in Alleppey, from the rewarding sight of the sea to the wriggling inlets of backwaters and jungle streams- No wonder Alleppey was called the “Venice of the east” by Lord Curzon. The concept of houseboats which is locally called Kettuvallam in Malayalam is a primitive practice in Kerala. Located around 53 kilometers from Cochin, the town is celebrated for its backwaters which connect Cochin and Kumarakom to the North. Besides backwaters and the sea, Alleppey is also famous for its ageless temples, serpentine canals draining into the ocean, colorful lagoons, rice paddies, and a 150-year old lighthouse.  While you are soaking up the laid-back coastal bliss, do try to visit the famous Andhakaranazhi Beach- the beauty gets amplified during sunset hours. </p>

        <h5>Pathiramanal</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Pathiramanal, which means “Sands of the Night”, is a small lake island located on the backwaters of Alappuzha in Lake Vembanad. It is a bird watcher’s paradise since it is supposed to hold approximately 91 local species of birds and 50 species of migratory birds. The location of the island is extremely scenic, making it a lovely space to observe birds and the water.

            It is also completely uninhabited so you don’t have to worry about the crowd and hawkers disrupting the beauty. However, because it is uninhabited and not a major tourist hotspot, you will find that it lacks the usual facilities that bring tourists to comfort. Let this not be a distraction since the island is very small and can be toured within an hour, which means that you won’t necessarily be inconvenienced by the lack of facilities, especially if you go prepared.</p>

            This is one of the biggest churches and parishes of the Archeparchy of Changanassery. Currently, the church is known for housing 2500 families and is one of those Alleppey tourist places that are popularly visited by the masses. The church organizes two feasts or festivals every year. The first one of them is St. Mary’s Feast. Since the church is dedicated to the Virgin Mary, hence every year on the third Sunday of September, a feast is organized by the Church. People visit the church on this day and participate in the festival wearing special costumes for the procession and mass.</p>

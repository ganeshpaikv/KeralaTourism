        <h5>Ezhimala</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Perched at a height of 286 meters, the Ezhimala hill is one of the most visually appealing Kannur tourist places. The hill is a part of an isolated cluster of hills and the vantage point offers bedazzling views of the sheer naked natural splendour around – hills covered in a blanket of green, cotton white clouds covering the clear blue skies, and the beautiful valley underneath. 

          The place also has cultural and historical significance – the place was a battlefield during the Chola-Chera wars. Buddhists consider the place sacred because it is believed that Lord Buddha visited Ezhimala.</p>
